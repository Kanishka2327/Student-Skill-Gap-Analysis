Student Skill Gap Analysis


📌 Overview


Student Skill Gap Analysis is a data-driven project that identifies gaps between the skills students currently possess and the skills demanded by the job market. The goal is to help students, educational institutions, and career counselors understand which areas require improvement to better align with industry expectations.

🧠 Objective


To analyze student profiles and skillsets, compare them with market-required skills, and highlight the skill gaps, enabling students to upskill in relevant areas for better employability.

🛠️ Features


Upload student data and skillset information.

Match current skills against job roles and industry expectations.

Identify missing or weak skills.

Generate skill gap reports and recommendations.

Useful insights for academic institutions to update their curriculum.

🔍 Tech Stack


Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for data analysis)

Streamlit (for interactive web interface)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)

GitHub (for version control)

📊 How It Works


Student data is collected in CSV format (including skills, course data, etc.).

Data preprocessing and skill mapping are done using Python.

A comparison is made between individual student skills and required job-role skills.

A skill gap analysis report is generated.

The interface is deployed using Streamlit for easy interaction.

📈 Example Use Case


A student uploads their profile containing known programming languages and project experience.

The system compares their profile against the job description of a “Data Analyst”.

It highlights missing skills like “SQL” or “Power BI” and suggests learning paths.

🎯 Future Enhancements
